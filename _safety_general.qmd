Whenever carrying out experimental work it is important to be aware of any dangers in your experiment or in the room around you.  Please take a moment when you enter the laboratory to familiarise yourself with the room and the other equipment around you.
If you have any relevant issue please discuss these with your demonstrator or lecturer.
